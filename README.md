Senior Design Competition (RobotC)

Overview:

The goal of this project is to have a robot that traverses through an obstacle course. A light sensor points down to read the bit encoding (represented by black and white stripes) in order to figure out which planet it has to traverse through among the 3 choices. An ultrasonic sensor is placed at the front to sense obstacles that the robot may hit as it moves forward, like an asteroid belt.

After dodging the obstacles, the robot must navigate to the corresponding planet and orbit around it once.

How to Run:

	1) Open up RobotC IDE
	2) Open utek2014_prototype.c
	3) Compile and download the code into the NXT brick
	4) Click Start.
